# Build

> Note: Please ensure the version of Node and NPM you are using are >= the minimum LTS Node and NPM versions specified in the package.json file. The recommended Node and NPM versions are LTS versions (i.e. even-numbered releases). Run `node --version && npm --version` to get the versions of Node and NPM on your system if unsure.

Clone the repo locally and install the required npm dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Zero-1729/volt
cd volt
yarn install
```

To run the wallet locally on, and build for, Android or IOS you'll need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) installed, respectively. 

## Development

To run the wallet locally on your system, run the following in the project root (`volt/`):

> This will start the Metro Bundler, which is the tool responsible for bundling the app's JavaScript code and assets into a single file that can be run on the device.

```sh
$ yarn run start
```

### Note on Tailwind

Due to the way Tailwind works, you'll need to run the following command to build the Tailwind CSS file:

> This builds the Tailwind styles in watch mode. You'll need to run this command in a separate terminal window to keep the Tailwind styles updated before running the app.

```sh
$ yarn run dev:tailwind
```


### Running on Android (Virtual) Device

- Download and run the latest (stable) version of Android Studio.
- Launch Android Studio, and Open the project's android folder (`volt/android`).
- Open the `build.gradle` file in the current folder (`volt/android`), it'll take some time for Android Studio to set up.
- Navigate to `AVD Manager` under the `Tools` sections of the menu, and click "*Create Virtual Device...*" to create a virtual device.
- Launch the newly created virtual device by clicking the `Play` in the `Actions` section of the menu.

After setting up the virtual device, run the following in the project root (`volt/`) to launch the emulator:

> The command builds the app and installs it on the virtual device or a connected Android device (if detected). Once launched, the app would take time loading the dependencies. 

```sh
$ yarn run android
```

### Running on IOS

To run the app using XCode's IOS emulator, you'll need to install the CocoaPod dependencies:

```sh
$ cd ios
$ yarn pod install
```

After installing the dependencies, to launch the app on the IOS emulator you'll need to navigate to the project root (`volt`) and run:

> Note: If you have issues running the command above, you can also open Xcode and open the `ios/volt.xcworkspace` file and build/run the app from there.

```sh
yarn run ios
```
